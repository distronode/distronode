minor_changes:
  - distronode-galaxy - used to crash out with a "Errno 20 Not a directory" error when extracting files from a role when hitting a file with an illegal name (https://github.com/distronode/distronode/pull/81553). Now it gives a warning identifying the culprit file and the rule violation (e.g., ``my$class.jar`` has a ``$`` in the name) before crashing out, giving the user a chance to remove the invalid file and try again. (https://github.com/distronode/distronode/pull/81555).

known_issues:
  - distronode-galaxy - dies in the middle of installing a role when that role contains Java inner classes (files with $ in the file name).  This is by design, to exclude temporary or backup files. (https://github.com/distronode/distronode/pull/81553).
