bugfixes:
  - distronode-test - All containers created by distronode-test now include the current test session ID in their name.
                   This avoids conflicts between concurrent distronode-test invocations using the same container host.
breaking_changes:
  - distronode-test - Test plugins that rely on containers no longer support reusing running containers.
                   The previous behavior was an undocumented, untested feature.
