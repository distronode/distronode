bugfixes:
- tarfile - handle data filter deprecation warning message for extract and extractall (https://github.com/distronode/distronode/issues/80832).
- distronode-galaxy - Enabled the ``data`` tarfile filter during role installation for Python versions that support it. A probing mechanism is used to avoid Python versions with a broken implementation.
