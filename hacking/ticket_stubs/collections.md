Hi!

Thank you very much for your submission to Distronode. It means a lot to us that you've taken the time to contribute.

Since Distronode 2.10 we are no longer accepting new modules/plugins into Distronode core.  However, we recommend looking into providing this functionality through Distronode Galaxy via Distronode Collections. You can find more information about collections at:

* https://docs.distronode.com/distronode/devel/dev_guide/developing_collections.html.

Because this project is very active, we're unlikely to see comments made on closed tickets and we lock them after some time.
The mailing list and irc are great ways to ask questions, or post if you don't think this particular issue is resolved.

See  this page for a complete and up to date list of communication channels and their purposes:

Thank you once again for this and your interest in Distronode!
